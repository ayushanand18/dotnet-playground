## C# Basics
This sheet contains basics for C# language. PS. C# is fun and amazing. I feel it's the intersection of all languages I know, Java, Javascript and C++.

### Key Findings
What findings I got after learning so much about C#
+ C# defaults all camelCase function names whereas C++ defaults for underscores ('_'). So it might take some time to switch contexts or else you mix up both.


### Functions
command|description
-------|-----------
Console.WriteLine(string)| Writes string in the console
